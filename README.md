# ASC License Scraper

This repository contains a Python script designed to scrape email addresses from a specific web page by automating the process of entering license numbers and solving reCAPTCHA using the 2Captcha service.

## Description

The `asc_scraper.py` script is a web scraper that utilizes Selenium to automate browser actions and 2Captcha to solve reCAPTCHA challenges. The primary function of the script is to navigate through a licensing website, enter a license number, solve the reCAPTCHA, and retrieve relevant information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Selenium
- Requests
- Chrome WebDriver
- 2Captcha API key

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ASC_License_Scraper.git
    cd ASC_License_Scraper
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
    Ensure you have your 2Captcha API key set in your environment variables:
    ```bash
    export 2CAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_2captcha_api_key
    ```

4. **Download Chrome WebDriver**
    Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in a directory included in your system PATH.

## Usage

To run the scraper script, use the following command:
```bash
python asc_scraper.py
```

## Script Workflow

1. **Initialize WebDriver**: Launches a Chrome browser instance.
2. **Navigate to Website**: Opens the login page of the target website.
3. **Navigate to Search Page**: Clicks through to the licensing search page.
4. **Enter License Number**: Inputs a predefined license number.
5. **Solve reCAPTCHA**: Uses the 2Captcha service to solve the reCAPTCHA.
6. **Submit Form**: Submits the search form and retrieves the result.

## Issue

Despite setting up the script correctly and ensuring the 2Captcha service works with manual `curl` requests, the script fails at the point of solving the reCAPTCHA. The `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the response from 2Captcha is not in the expected format, suggesting that the request to 2Captcha may not be correctly formatted or handled in the script.

## Goal

The goal is to successfully integrate the 2Captcha solution with the Selenium script to automate the process of solving reCAPTCHA challenges. This involves:
1. **Correctly Sending Requests to 2Captcha**: Ensure the request to solve the reCAPTCHA is properly formatted and sent.
2. **Handling Responses Appropriately**: Properly parse and handle the responses from 2Captcha to retrieve the CAPTCHA solution.
3. **Automating Form Submission**: Integrate the reCAPTCHA solution into the form submission process to retrieve the desired information from the website.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify API Key**: Ensure the 2Captcha API key is correct and has sufficient balance.
2. **Manual Verification with `curl`**: Use `curl` to manually test the 2Captcha request and verify the service works.
3. **Refine Script**: Add detailed logging and error handling to diagnose and resolve issues with the script.
